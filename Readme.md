# Ships 'R' Rockin'
## Global Game Jam 2017

## Introduction

This is a Game created by the two man team of Joshua Cook (@JishyJoshy) and Jamie Robertson (@Lfcme).
The game is a turn based stratgy game with local multiplayer. Both teams are on either side of a watery battleground and not only will they have to fight each other, but, the waves that crash through the centre of the battlefield.

## Key Features

- Procedurally generated battlefield with symmetry for fair battle
- Terrain effecting the wave attacks
- Created in Unity 5.3 - Upgraded to 5.5
- Smooth Camera Transitions using DOTween!

More to come! This development will hopefully carry on to create a good game experience!
